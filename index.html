<p>I want to have the ability to quickly and easily capture mood states either by free form text description and/or checklist.
I want to know enough html and CSS to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create the form(s)</li>
<li>cleanly style the forms and the page for desktop, tablet and mobile screens (responsive design)</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to learn just enough Javascript and PHP to:
 <ul>
 <li>pass the submissions to a database</li>
 </ul>
</p>

</body>
